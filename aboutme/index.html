    <h2></h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, I'm Melina, an Accounting student in Argentina. I come from a large family,  I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was eight years old, and I am currently serving as a women's young counselor in my ward.
        
        I consider myself a self-taught person to learn. I have watched videos and read a bit of HTML, CSS, and Python, I am excited to learn more about the IT world, and I am taking this class to obtain my first web development certificate.
        My hobbies are playing the piano and exercising.
        I love seeing new places and getting to know new cultures. I have lived in the United States for two years in a cultural exchange program.</p>
